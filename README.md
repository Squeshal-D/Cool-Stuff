Some single-scripts that I want to keep.

## Pathfinder.cs

Made this script on a collaborative Unity project. It lets a gameobject pathfind through a top-down, non-grid environment. Even accounts for the gameobject's collision box. 

## main.java

As a quiz for my college senior capstone class, I chose to answer this question out of three questions:

a)	Text compression: Develop an algorithm to compress a given string of text by identifying repeated patterns.

I had 1 hour and 30 minutes minutes to create my solution and write a document explaining the algorithm. I wrote this in an hour or less, given it took around 15 - 20 minutes to create a nice document and I finished before class was over with much time to spare. It compresses strings consisitng of letters only.
